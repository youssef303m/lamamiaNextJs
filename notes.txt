Importing images from the public folder requires width and height (Recommended)
  <Image src="/logo.png" width={15} height={15} alt="" />
Or you can just fill the image in the nearest relative container
  <Image src="/logo.png" fill={true} alt="" />

Importing images as a component doesn't require width and height
  <Image src={HeroImg} alt="" />

Next.js doesn't allow to use any external images from other domains
If you want to add an external image you need to write it in configuration file next.config.js
  const nextConfig = {
    images: {
      domains: ["images.pexels.com"],
    },
  };

If you're using context api the component should be a client side
  "use client"
